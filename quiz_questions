What is the significance of the 'Content-Type' header in an HTTP request? ]
- 🔐 To indicate the security level
* 🧾 To specify the format of the data being sent
- 🔒 To authenticate the sender
- 🔁 To redirect the request
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "To specify the format of the data being sent"
Content-Type tells the server how to parse the request body (e.g., JSON, form data).

[Poll:1555:🐞 OWASP time!
In what way does the Transfer-Encoding header impact security vulnerabilities? ]
- ✅ It cannot influence security
- 🔐 It can lead to data encryption
* ⚙️ It affects the way requests are processed
- 🔁 It is used only in GET requests
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "It affects the way requests are processed"
Transfer-Encoding changes body framing and can create parsing inconsistencies exploitable by attackers.

[Poll:1556:🐞 OWASP time!
Which of the following is a mitigation strategy against HTTP request smuggling? ]
- ⚠️ Using only HTTP 1.1
- 🚫 Ignoring transfer-encoding
* 🛠️ Standardizing server configurations
- ✅ Allowing chunked requests
> Explanation:

- 🚫 Using raw input without filters
- ✅ Validating only input lengths
- 🤝 Trusting user data completely
* ✔️ Applying strong validation rules
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Applying strong validation rules"
Validate types/allowed fields and reject unexpected parameters server-side.

[Poll:1558:🐞 OWASP time!
Which security principle suggests that users should have the minimum level of access required for functionality? ]
- 🔓 Full Access
- 🛑 Parameter Acceptance
- ⚠️ Overriding Control
* 🧭 Least Privilege
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Least Privilege"
Granting only necessary permissions limits damage from compromised accounts.

What is an indicator that a web application is potentially vulnerable to mass assignment? ]
- ✅ Integration with robust frameworks
- ✅ Consistent use of authentication
- ✅ Predefined user roles with limits
* ⚠️ Ability to set user roles via input
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Ability to set user roles via input"
If roles can be assigned from client input, attackers may escalate privileges.

[Poll:1560:🐞 OWASP time!
What does the term 'Broken Object Level Authorization' refer to? ]
- 🧾 Insecure database connections
- 🧼 Unvalidated user inputs
- 🧾 Weak password policies
* 🚫 A lack of access control checks
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "A lack of access control checks"
BOLA occurs when APIs don't verify if the caller can access a specific object.

[Poll:1561:🐞 OWASP time!
Which programming practice assists in managing mass assignment vulnerabilities? ]
- 🧾 Adding more database entries
- 🔀 Using dynamic input processing
- 🚫 Disabling all validations
* 🔍 Employing strict parameter filtering
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Employing strict parameter filtering"
Filter inputs to accept only known/allowed fields before assignment.

[Poll:1562:🐞 OWASP time!
What approach is NOT effective for preventing mass assignment vulnerabilities? ]
- ✅ Using whitelisting
- ✅ Explicitly defining fields
- ✅ Proper input validation
* ❌ Ignoring server-side checks
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Ignoring server-side checks"
Relying solely on client-side controls and ignoring server checks leaves you vulnerable.

[Poll:1563:🐞 OWASP time!
Which of the following best describes the concept of 'whitelisting' in application security? ]
- 🚫 Allowing all actions until blocked
- 🎲 Randomly validating permissions
- 🔥 Denying all actions by default
* ✅ Permitting only known safe actions
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Permitting only known safe actions"
Whitelisting accepts only explicitly allowed inputs or operations.

[Poll:1564:🐞 OWASP time!
What is the primary objective of whitelisting parameters in application security? ]
- 🔓 To allow all inputs
- ❌ To block all unknown inputs
* ✅ To specifically allow known safe inputs
- ⚡ To enhance performance
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "To specifically allow known safe inputs"
Whitelisting defines an explicit set of acceptable parameters to reduce risk.

[Poll:1565:🐞 OWASP time!
What is the main risk of HTTP request smuggling attacks? ]
- ✅ Data loss
- 🐢 Slow server response
* 🔓 Unauthorized access to user accounts
- ✅ Improved data integrity
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Unauthorized access to user accounts"
Smuggling can cause requests to be interpreted as other users’, enabling unauthorized actions.

[Poll:1566:🐞 OWASP time!
What is a common safeguard against mass assignment vulnerabilities in APIs? ]
- ❌ Accept all parameters by default
- ✅ Disallow all user input
- ✅ Implement verbose logging
* 🧩 Use of built-in serializer methods
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Use of built-in serializer methods"
Serializers let you declare explicit fields and automatically reject extras.

[Poll:1567:🐞 OWASP time!
Which method is often used by attackers to exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities? ]
- 🔐 Data encryption
- 🗂️ Direct SQL queries
- 📤 File uploads
* 🕵️ Using hidden fields
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Using hidden fields"
Attackers add hidden form inputs to set fields the UI doesn't expose, exploiting unfiltered binding.

[Poll:1568:🐞 OWASP time!
How can HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities generally be mitigated? ]
- ⚡ By speeding up server response times
- ✅ Utilizing robust logging mechanisms
- ✅ Ignoring the existing protocols
* 🔧 Standardizing request formats between servers
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Standardizing request formats between servers"
Make front-end, proxies, and back-ends parse headers identically to prevent mismatches.

[Poll:1569:🐞 OWASP time!
What role does the HTTP header 'Transfer-Encoding' play in web security? ]
- 🔐 Secures user credentials
- 🗺️ Indicates request routing
* 🧩 Affects how request bodies are processed
- 🚧 Limits incoming traffic
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Affects how request bodies are processed"
`Transfer-Encoding` tells servers how the body is framed; mismatches can be abused.

[Poll:1570:🐞 OWASP time!
What does the term 'Least Privilege' imply in security practices? ]
- ✅ Users should have full access to all features
- 🚫 Services should operate without access controls
* 🔐 Users should only have access necessary for tasks
- 🔓 All user actions should be allowed by default
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Users should only have access necessary for tasks"
Granting minimal privileges reduces potential attack surface and damage.

[Poll:1571:🐞 OWASP time!
Which feature of HTTP allows for sending data in segments instead of a single block? ]
- 📄 Content-Length
* 🧾 Transfer-Encoding
- 🧭 Content-Type
- 🔁 Response-Encoding
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "Transfer-Encoding"
Chunked transfer uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to stream data in parts.

[Poll:1572:🐞 OWASP time!
Why is the Content-Type header important in an HTTP request? ]
- 🔐 To specify security protocols
* 📝 To define the type of media being sent
- 🔐 To validate user authentication
- 📦 To cache the response
> Explanation:
Correct Answer: "To define the type of media being sent"
Servers rely on Content-Type to correctly parse the request body (e.g., JSON vs form data).
